To convert a raw asset to a webp file, run the following command with the
correct raw asset and target paths:
  cwebp raw_asset_path -o target_path

For example, to convert a png file located at "rawassets/bone_icon.png" to a
webp file located at "assets/textures/bone_icon.webp", you would run:
  cwebp rawassets/bone_icon.png -o assets/textures/bone_icon.webp
